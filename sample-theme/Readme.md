# Sample theme to use the role-authenticator

In order to display a proper error message to users, which do not have the access rights to authenticate with a client, you need to include the `denied-auth.ftl` template in your theme or use our theme directly.

## Installation

To use the theme, please place the contents of this directory to a directory (name it as you like) in the Keycloak themes path. In case of Docker containers this is `/opt/jboss/keycloak/themes/<your theme name>`.
